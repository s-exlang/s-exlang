## Use as assembler
- [ ] Use [fasmg](https://board.flatassembler.net/topic.php?t=21212) as assembler
    - [ ] Ressources for [fasm](https://board.flatassembler.net/topic.php?t=19389)
    - [X] Compile the [DLL](https://github.com/tgrysztar/fasmg/blob/177b011a99667378ce801c859586393141ed3254/packages/x86/projects/calculator/make.bat#L3) for use with the compiler 
        - [ ] Make a 64 bit version based off what was done for [fasm](https://board.flatassembler.net/topic.php?p=207558#207558)
    - [X] Add function [definitions](https://board.flatassembler.net/topic.php?t=21212) of DLL to a .h 
    - [ ] Make a Linux version of the library, [example in 32 bit](https://board.flatassembler.net/topic.php?t=4964) to use with [fasmg](https://chat.openai.com/share/2fcd9d0a-4691-4861-aa30-2dba6dae9318)
    
    

## Info and research
- [ ] Example [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyhxH-QuEhM)
- [ ] Do research on [binary formats](https://board.flatassembler.net/topic.php?t=20690#205881)
    - [ ] Try to generate [APE binaries](https://justine.lol/ape.html)
- [ ] [Playground](https://github.com/bitRAKE/fasmg_playground) for fasmg with examples(like a live shader editor)
